Prop 65, a state law that's been in effect since 1986, requires that consumers in California get this warning. If you live outside of California and got this warning, don't fret!<\/p><p><br\/>The long answer:<br\/><br\/>Under Prop 65, the State of California maintains a list of chemicals known to the state to potentially cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. The current list has nearly 900 chemicals!  And it is not uncommon for certain Prop 65-listed chemicals, such as naturally-occurring heavy metals found in soils and the ocean, to be absorbed by plants and ultimately end up in organic, plant-based foods, supplements, and cosmetic ingredients. Because our products include plant-based ingredients that might include detectable levels of naturally-occurring heavy metals, we’re required to provide a Prop 65 warning on certain Love Wellness products. <br\/><br\/>In California, these warnings are found in restaurants, grocery stores, nutritional supplement shops, coffee shops, gyms, and even hospitals and are placed on products ranging from snacks and nutritional supplements to cosmetics, just to name a few.<br\/><br\/>You can find some common questions <a href=\"https:\/\/lovewellness.com\/pages\/noncacsdwtea\">here<\/a> and more details from California's Prop 65 website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.p65warnings.ca.gov\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>"}},"03516b48-2364-4ff6-b5bb-8a5b7e9de747":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"How does Love Wellness practice sustainability?","answer":"<p>We're actively in the process of reassessing all corners of the business in an effort to become more sustainable and earth friendly.

Should I be concerned?","answer":"<p>A change in your urine color to bright yellow is totally normal when taking a multivitamin like Daily Love™, Baby Love™, or Whole Love™. This is caused by Vitamin B complex, but specifically Vitamin B2, known as Riboflavin. B-complex vitamins are water-soluble vitamins and are not stored in the body (unlike other vitamins and minerals), which means they are dissolved in water and are quickly absorbed by your body. Any excess vitamins your body doesn’t need will be eliminated through urine, causing that change in color.
